        title: "Air Conditioner (AC)",
        alt: "Air Conditioner (AC)",
        Description: "Air Conditioner (AC): The air conditioner in a car is responsible for cooling and dehumidifying the interior of the vehicle. It works by compressing and circulating refrigerant through a system of coils and fans, which removes heat from the air inside the car and expels it outside. The AC system typically includes components such as the compressor, condenser, evaporator, expansion valve, and refrigerant lines. When the AC is turned on, it helps maintain a comfortable temperature inside the car, especially during hot weather conditions.",

        title: "Accelerator",
        alt: "Accelerator",
        Description: "The accelerator, also known as the gas pedal, is a crucial component of a vehicle's control system. It is typically located on the floor of the driver's side and is used to regulate the engine's power output and control the speed of the vehicle. When the driver presses down on the accelerator pedal, it sends a signal to the engine's throttle body or fuel injection system to increase the amount of fuel and air mixture entering the engine. This results in an increase in engine RPM (revolutions per minute) and subsequently increases the vehicle's speed. The more the accelerator pedal is pressed, the more fuel is delivered to the engine, leading to higher speeds. Conversely, releasing the accelerator pedal reduces fuel flow, causing the vehicle to slow down. The accelerator is an essential part of driving, allowing the driver to control acceleration and maintain desired speeds while driving.",

        img: clutch,
        title: "Clutch",
        alt: "Clutch",
        Description: "A clutch is a mechanical device that connects and disconnects the power transmission from the engine to the drivetrain in a vehicle. It is typically found in vehicles with manual transmissions, although some automatic transmissions also use a clutch system. The primary function of a clutch is to allow the driver to smoothly engage and disengage the engine's power to the wheels, enabling gear changes and controlling the vehicle's speed. When the clutch pedal is pressed, it disengages the clutch, separating the engine from the transmission. This allows the driver to change gears without causing damage to the transmission. When the clutch pedal is released, it engages the clutch, allowing power to flow from the engine to the wheels, propelling the vehicle forward. The clutch consists of several components, including the clutch disc, pressure plate, flywheel, and release bearing. Proper use and maintenance of the clutch are essential for smooth driving and preventing premature wear and tear on the vehicle's transmission system.",

        title: "Transmission",
        alt: "Transmission",
        Description: "A transmission, also known as a gearbox, is a crucial component of a vehicle's drivetrain that is responsible for transmitting power from the engine to the wheels. It allows the driver to control the vehicle's speed and torque by selecting different gear ratios. The transmission consists of a series of gears and gear sets that can be engaged or disengaged to change the speed and torque output. There are two main types of transmissions: manual and automatic. In a manual transmission, the driver manually selects and engages the gears using a clutch pedal and gear shift lever. In an automatic transmission, the vehicle's computer system automatically selects and changes gears based on factors such as speed, load, and throttle position. The transmission plays a vital role in optimizing engine performance, fuel efficiency, and overall driving experience. Proper maintenance of the transmission, including regular fluid changes and inspections, is essential to ensure its longevity and smooth operation.",
